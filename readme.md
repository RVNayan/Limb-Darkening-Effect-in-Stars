Limb darkening is a phenomenon where the Sun’s layers become darker as we move away from its centre 
to one of its corners. In scientific words, it’s an optical effect where as the line of sight increases the deeper layers of the sun can be seen. The word ‘Limb’ or ‘Limbus’ stands for corner/edges and their darkening has termed this phenomenon as Limb darkening.
